**Builder | Learning by Doing | Always Experimenting**

> "The best way to understand something is to build it. The best way to build something is to just start."

## 🎯 What I Do

I build **AI-powered systems, integrations, and tools**—usually trying something new in the process. Go, Python, SQL. Agents, APIs, data pipelines. If it needs to be built, I'm interested.

Right now obsessed with:
- 🤖 **AI Agents** — Building intelligent systems that actually do useful things
- 🔗 **Integrations** — Connecting disparate systems with elegant APIs
- 📊 **Data & Analysis** — Finding insights in the noise
- 🛠️ **Developer Tools** — Making other builders' lives easier

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:**
Go (learning) • Python • SQL

**Domains:**
- **AI/ML:** LangGraph, Agents, RAG, Vector DBs
- **Data:** Pandas, Jupyter, dbt, Analytics Engineering, SQL
- **DevOps:** Terraform, LocalStack, AWS, Docker
- **APIs:** REST, GraphQL, MCP, gRPC concepts

**Methodologies:**

## 🧠 How I Work

1. **See a problem** → Wonder how to solve it
2. **Build a prototype** → Get hands dirty immediately
3. **Break it** → Learn from the failures
4. **Iterate** → Ship something useful
5. **Repeat** → Always trying something new

Not a "plan everything then execute" person. I'm a "start with a clear goal, adapt as you learn" builder.

## 🎨 Fun Facts

- 🐹 Obsessed with building **CLI tools**—terminals are my canvas
- 📚 Self-directed learner—each project is a learning lab
- 🔄 Believe in **continuous experimentation**
- 🌍 Working across **Go, Python, SQL** ecosystems
- ⚡ Speed and clarity matter—in code and thinking
- 🤝 Love integrating systems that weren't meant to talk to each other

## 🧪 Learning & Exploration

A lot of my projects are just for **learning and fun**. I believe in shipping experimental work, diving into new tools, and seeing what sticks. Some repos are prototypes, some are learning labs, some turn into production systems. That's the builder way—you never know what'll spark the next big thing until you try it.
