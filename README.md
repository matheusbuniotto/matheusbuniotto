# Hi, I'm Matheus! 👋

> Building tools to make computers do the boring stuff.

I'm a developer who learns by breaking things. I love **Go**, **Python**, and making **AI Agents** talk to APIs they probably shouldn't.

Currently, I'm obsessed with the intersection of **CLI tools**, **LLMs**, and **System Integration**. If there's a way to automate it or wrap it in a TUI, I'm probably trying to build it.

### 🧪 The Lab (Current Experiments)

| Project | The "Why" | Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🤖 [**go-google-mcp**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/go-google-mcp) | Because I wanted my AI to manage my calendar. Use with caution. | `Go` `MCP` `Google Workspace` |
| 🧠 [**goAgent**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/goAgent) | Built my own agent framework to see how the magic trick works. | `Go` `Agents` `Tool Use` |
| 🔌 [**openwebui-tools**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/openwebui-tools) | Plugging new superpowers into OpenWebUI. | `Python` `WebUI` `Integrations` |

### 🛠️ The Toolkit

**Languages I Speak:**
- 🐍 **Python:** My native tongue. Great for data, ML, and glue code.
- 🐹 **Go:** My current adventure. Loving the speed and the types.
- 💾 **SQL:** The universal truth.

**Things I Poke At:**
- **AI/ML:** LangGraph, RAG, Vector DBs (making data searchable).
- **DevOps:** Terraform, Docker (making it run elsewhere).
- **CLI:** I live in the terminal.

### 🧠 How I Work
1. **Curiosity:** "I wonder if I can build X..."
2. **Panic:** "I have no idea how to build X."
3. **Action:** Read docs, write bad code, refactor.
4. **Ship:** It works! (Mostly.)

### ⚡ Random Packets
- 🌍 I'm exploring the **Go** ecosystem deeply right now.
- 🎨 I treat my terminal like a creative canvas.
- 🤝 I believe software is better when it's open and shared.
