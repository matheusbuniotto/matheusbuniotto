# Matheus Buniotto

**Builder | Explorer | Chronic Experimenter**

I spent years deep in **Data Science and A/B Testing**, obsessing over statistics and user behavior. Now, I’m applying that experimental DNA to the **AI space** to build systems that actually solve problems.

This profile is a collection of projects built for **fun and learning**. I’m a builder by nature—I build because I’m curious, and I use my background in data to validate whether what I’ve built is actually useful or just a good theory.

### The Lab
*Current experiments and highlighted work.*

| Project | The "Why" | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**context-kit**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/context-kit) | **Active Development.** Bridging the gap between AI agents and project context. | Go, Git |
| [**goAgent**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/goAgent) | A lean, bare-bones AI agent framework focused on tool-use patterns. | Go, LLMs |
| [**go-google-mcp**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/go-google-mcp) | Testing the limits of Go and MCP by connecting AI to the Google ecosystem. | Go, MCP, Google API |
| [**datathon-mlops**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/datathon-mlops-rh-ia) | A reminder of my data roots—winning by building robust ML pipelines. | Python, MLOps |

### The Toolkit

**The Data Foundation**
*Years of experience in measurement and research.*
* **A/B Testing & Statistics:** I don't guess; I test. My DNA is built on statistical validation.
* **Python:** My native tongue for ML, data engineering, and rapid prototyping.
* **SQL:** Fluent in data extraction, transformation, and large-scale analysis.

**The Builder Frontier**
*Moving into AI and systems programming.*
* **AI Agents:** Designing autonomous systems focused on reliability and context.
* **Go:** Learning it because it’s fast and powerful for building robust system utilities.
* **CLI & Automation:** I live in the terminal. If I can't script it, I probably don't want to do it.

### How I Build
1. **Curiosity:** "I wonder if I can build X or automate Y..."
2. **Panic:** "I have absolutely no idea how to build X."
3. **Action:** Dive into documentation, write bad code, and figure it out by doing.
4. **Obsession:** Spend the next couple of weeks thinking about nothing else until it's finished.
5. **Ship:** It's built. Now, what's next?

### Random Packets
* **Test Everything:** I trust data and prototypes over opinions.
* **Always Learning:** If I haven't broken it yet, I haven't learned it.
* **Open to Chaos:** Most of this is experimental. Feel free to break things with me.

### Let's Chat
Grab a repo, steal some code, or [open an issue](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/matheusbuniotto/issues). I'm always down to talk about AI architecture, data experiments, or building cool stuff with Go.

*Built with curiosity, data, and a healthy dose of trial and error.*
