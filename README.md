# Hi, I'm Matheus! 👋

> Builder. Explorer. Chronic Experimenter.

I spent years deep in **Data Science and A/B Testing**, obsessing over stats and user behavior. Now, I’m taking that experimental DNA and moving into **AI** to build stuff that actually *does* things.

**Fair warning:** This repo is mostly projects for **fun or learning**. I don't build to follow a "best practice" checklist—I'm a builder. I build because I'm curious, and I've got years of data experience to tell me if I'm full of shit or if I've actually made something better.

### 🧪 The Lab (Current Experiments & Highlights)

| Project | The "Why" | Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🛠️ [**context-kit**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/context-kit) | **Building right now.** Trying to give AI agents a better "memory" of project context. | `Go` `Git` |
| 🤖 [**go-google-mcp**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/go-google-mcp) | Can I make an AI manage my life via Google Workspace? Let's find out. | `Go` `MCP` |
| 🏆 [**datathon-mlops**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/datathon-mlops-rh-ia) | My data roots. Winning at MLOps by building robust pipelines. | `Python` `MLOps` |
| 📊 [**clustering_deputados**](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/clustering_deputados) | Turning messy political data into clusters because patterns are everywhere. | `Python` `ML` |

### 🛠️ The Toolkit

**The Data Foundation:**
- 📉 **A/B Testing & Stats:** Years of experience making sure I’m not just guessing.
- 🐍 **Python:** My native tongue for ML, data, and messy research.
- 💾 **SQL:** I’ve written enough queries to see them in my sleep.

**The Builder Frontier:**
- 🤖 **AI Agents:** Exploring the intersection of LLMs and local context.
- 🐹 **Go:** Learning it because it's fast and powerful as hell for building systems.
- 🐚 **CLI:** I live in the terminal. If I can't script it, I probably don't want to do it.

### 🧠 How I Build
1. **Curiosity:** "I wonder if I can build X..."
2. **Panic:** "I have absolutely no idea how to build X."
3. **Action:** Dive into docs, write bad code, and figure it out by doing.
4. **Obsession:** Spend the next couple of weeks thinking about nothing else until it's done.
5. **Ship:** It's built. Now, what's next?

### ⚡ Random Packets
- 🧪 **Test Everything:** I trust data and prototypes more than opinions.
- 📚 **Always Learning:** If I haven't broken it yet, I haven't learned it.
- 🤝 **Open to Chaos:** Most of this is experimental. Feel free to break things with me.

### 📬 Let's Chat
Grab a repo, steal some code, or [open an issue](https://github.com/matheusbuniotto/matheusbuniotto/issues). I'm always down to talk about AI, data experiments, or why building things is the best way to learn.

⭐ *Built with curiosity, data, and a healthy dose of trial and error.*
